title: Logging with Reportlab Platypus

<p>
If you're building a PDF from a platypus doctemplate with a lot of
flowables, the <code>doc.build(elements)</code> call can take a while.
You might want to put some logging calls in there to see how far along
it is.
</p>
<p>
It's easy to do this with Reportlab, though it seems to be
undocumented in the main Reportlab docs.  You can set a "progress
callback" on your doctemplate::
</p>
{% highlight python %}
from reportlab.platypus import SimpleDocTemplate
doc = SimpleDocTemplate("fleem.pdf")
doc.setProgressCallBack(logging_function)  # note the TripleCamelCase!
doc.build(lots_of_elements)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Your progress callback will be called with arguments (type, value)
periodically during the build.  The "type" argument depends on what's
going on at the moment, and the "value" argument has a different
meaning for each type.  Here's the different values I see used 
in <code>reportlab/platypus/doctemplate.py</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  ("STARTED", 0) when <code>doc.build</code> begins
</li>
<li>
  ("SIZE_EST", total_number_of_flowables) right after "STARTED", this gives
  you an approximate number of flowables that will be written to the
  PDF (it's only approximate because reportlab might internally add
  more, or you might filter some out)
</li>
<li>
  ("PROGRESS", number_of_flowables_handled_up_to_now) happens every
  time a flowable is processed
<li>
  ("PAGE", page_number) when starting a new page in the PDF
</li>
<li>
  ("FINISHED", 0) when the document is done building
</li>
<li>
  ("PASS", current_pass_number) on each pass through the document in a
  multibuild
</li>
</ul>

So for example here's a simple callback that just prints how many
flowables have been handled, out of the estimated total::

{% highlight python %}
class ProgressMeter(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.size_est = None
    def __call__(self, type, value):
        if type == "SIZE_EST":
            self.size_est = value
        elif type == "PROGRESS":
            print "%s flowables processed (out of %s or so)" % (
                value, self.size_est)

doc = SimpleDocTemplate("fleem.pdf")
callback = ProgressMeter()
doc.setProgressCallBack(callback)
doc.build(lots_of_flowables)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Note that you have to use something stateful like a class instance if
you want to hold onto the size estimate during later progress ticks.
