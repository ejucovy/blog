title: Using ConfigParser in Django Model Instances
categories:

<p>Suppose you have a Django model with a lot of persistent,
  configurable policy settings -- e.g. "is its content world-viewable
  or not", "what's the preferred frontend editor for this object",
  "should it be displayed with a header or not" and so on.</p>

<p>These sorts of policy settings have a few important characteristics
  in common:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Their value affects logic that's run on a single instance at a
    time.  So you probably don't need to run highly optimized relational
    queries on them &mdash; certainly not in your first iteration.
    Perhaps you'll eventually find you need optimized queries based on
    some of these fields, but you don't need to from the start.</li>
  <li>The possible values for a given setting might change over time,
    and might change a lot during initial development.</li>
  <li>The possible <em>settings</em> might change over time &mdash;
    new settings might be needed a long way down the road.</li>
  <li>Other than that, they don't have a lot in common with each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>Putting each of these sorts of settings in a dedicated database
  column can be more trouble than it's worth.  You'll be baking
  highly fluid assumptions into the structure of your database, when
  these are just the type of assumptions that are suited to iterative,
  flexible Python code.</p>

<p>Instead, I like to put all these settings into a single text blob
  &mdash; one column per model instance, instead of a separate column
  for each setting.  By storing the settings as if they were a Python
  INI file, you can read and write them using the stdlib's
  ConfigParser, and don't have to worry about any data migrations as
  the settings change.</p>

<p>The only slightly tricky thing is that ConfigParser can't act
  directly on strings &mdash; it only accepts file-like objects.  So
  you'll have to use a bit of indirection: wrap your model field in a
  StringIO whenever you're reading and writing it.  Putting this
  indirection into a single helper method on the model encapsulates those
  implementation details.</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

{% highlight python %}
## models.py
from ConfigParser import RawConfigParser
from ConfigParser import NoOptionError, NoSectionError
from StringIO import StringIO

class Configuration(models.Model):
    name = models.TextField()
    data = models.TextField()

    @models.permalink
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return ('view-configuration', [str(self.pk)])

    def __unicode__(self):
        return str(self.name or self.pk)

    def set_options(self, kwargs):
        config = RawConfigParser()
        fp = StringIO(self.data)
        config.readfp(fp)

        for key, val in kwargs.items():
            if key == "filter_by":
                if val is None:
                    config.remove_option("options", "filter_by")
                else:
                    config.set("options", key, " ".join(val))
            else:
                config.set("options", key, val)

        fp = StringIO()
        config.write(fp)
        fp.seek(0)
        self.data = fp.read()
        self.save()

    def get_option(self, key, default=NoDefault, asbool=False):
        config = RawConfigParser()
        fp = StringIO(self.data)

        config.readfp(fp)
        try:
            value = config.get("options", key)
        except (NoOptionError, NoSectionError):
            if default is NoDefault:
                raise
            return default

        if not asbool:
            return value.strip()

        value = value.lower()
        if value in ("1", "true", "t", "yes", "y", "on"):
            return True
        elif value in ("0", "false", "f", "no", "n", "off"):
            return False
        else:
            raise TypeError("Cannot convert to bool: %s" % value)

    def filter_by(self):
        filters = self.get_option("filter_by", "")
        return filters.split()
        
    def order_by(self):
        return self.get_option("order_by", "none").lower()

    def group_by(self):
        return self.get_option("group_by", "none").lower()

    def header(self):
        return self.get_option("header", None)

    def footer(self):
        return self.get_option("footer", None)

    def number_entries(self):
        return self.get_option("entrynumbers", default=False, asbool=True)

    def number_pages(self):
        return self.get_option("pagenumbers", default=False, asbool=True)

    def template(self):
        return self.get_option("template", "threecolumn_withcomments")
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Note all the glorious inelegance!  Each known setting gets its own
  accessor method on the model, which hides the implementation details
  and documents that setting's expected type, default value, and so
  on.  That makes it easy to "migrate" data as settings change; just
  change the code &mdash; add settings, change default values, provide
  extra error handlers that return the proper defaults or implicitly
  migrate bad data, whatever.</p>

<p>If you do ultimately find that some of these settings would be
  better off in their own database columns, the needed changes are
  localized: just replace the accessor method with a new model field,
  and handle its mutation either in the calling code or in the
  set_options method.
