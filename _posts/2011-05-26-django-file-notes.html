title: Notes on Django File Objects
---
<p>
Working with files in Django is a little awkward, because the
framework defines its own file object, whose interface is a superset
of the standard Python file object's.
</p>
<p>
The object is defined in <code>django.core.files.base.File</code>.  You need to
use it when working with <code>FileField</code>s.  Objects that you retrieve from
<code>request.FILES</code> are instances of this class, so the details can often
be ignored.  But if you're not getting your files from user uploads,
the details start to matter.
</p>
<p>
You can't just pass a standard Python file to a FileField::
</p>
{% highlight python %}
>>> class MyModel(models.Model):
...    file = models.FileField(upload_to="foo")

>>> some_file = open("some_file.txt")
>>> my_object = MyModel()
>>> my_object.file.save("some_file.txt", some_file)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'file' object has no attribute 'chunks'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Instead, you have to wrap the file in a <code>django.core.files.File</code> like so::
</p>

{% highlight python %}
>>> some_file = open("some_file.txt")
>>> my_object = MyModel()

>>> from django.core.files import File
>>> some_file = File(some_file)
>>> my_object.file.save("some_file.txt", some_file)

>>> my_object.save()
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
In Python, you can also work with files directly from a zip archive,
without extracting them.  But if you try to pass a file object to
Django directly from a zip archive using the same approach as above,
there's another problem::
</p>

{% highlight python %}
>>> import zipfile
>>> my_zip = zipfile.ZipFile("some_archive.zip")
>>> my_object = MyModel()

>>> some_file = my_zip.open("path/to/archived/file.txt")
>>> from django.core.files import File
>>> some_file = File(some_file)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: Unable to determine the file's size.
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The Django File object wants to know its size, and refuses to be
constructed if it can't determine its size.  One of the things it
looks for to determine its size is a <code>size</code> attribute on the
underlying file object.  So we can ask the zipfile for the
uncompressed size of the file we want, and set that attribute before
constructing a Django File::
</p>

{% highlight python %}
>>> import zipfile
>>> my_zip = zipfile.ZipFile("some_archive.zip")
>>> my_object = MyModel()

>>> some_file = my_zip.open("path/to/archived/file.txt")
>>> from django.core.files import File
>>> uncompressed_size = my_zip.getinfo("path/to/archived/file.txt").file_size
>>> some_file.size = uncompressed_size

>>> some_file = File(some_file)
>>> my_object.file.save(some_file)
>>> my_object.save()
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Now everything works without error.
