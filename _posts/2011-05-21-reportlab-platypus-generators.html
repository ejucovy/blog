title: Using Generators with Reportlab Platypus
---

Reportlab's `platypus.doctemplate` module is really nice, but I found
it weird that you have to pass a pre-built list of flowables to the
`build` command.  If you're building PDFs from a dataset, this means
you have to iterate over your dataset once to build the list of
flowables from your dataset; and then pass the list of flowables to
ReportLab, to iterate over it again.  That extra iteration seems
wasteful, and also forces you to hold the whole list of flowables in
memory before you start rendering the PDF.  

For large datasets, it might be nice to pass a generator instead of a
list.

I have a working proof of concept on a branch here:
https://github.com/ejucovy/reportlab/tree/generators

A side effect of the changes on this branch: you can also build a PDF
in multiple steps, because the code now lets you add one flowable at a
time to the document.  So on my branch, you can do something like
this::

{% highlight python %}
doc = reportlab.platypus.doctemplate("file.pdf")
doc.startBuild()
num_handled_flowables = 0
for item in generator_that_yields_flowables():
  num_handled_flowables = doc.buildFlowable(item, num_handled_flowables)
for item in another_flowable_generator():
  num_handled_flowables = doc.buildFlowable(item, num_handled_flowables)
doc.endBuild()
{% endhighlight %}

Or you can just pass a generator to the regular `doc.build` like so::

{% highlight python %}
doc = reportlab.platypus.doctemplate("file.pdf")
doc.build(generator_that_yields_flowables())
{% endhighlight %}

I dunno if this actually saves any significant time or space, though.
