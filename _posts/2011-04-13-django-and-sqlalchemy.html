title: Using SQLAlchemy with Django, alongside Django ORM
---

<h3>Why</h3>
<p>
N+1 databases: one local and writable, N remote and read-only.  The
remote database has a bunch of tables with relational data.  For the
project, I needed to query the remote database in various ways, and
then save some stuff in a local database, and do some things to the
stuff I saved.
</p>
<p>
I defined the local database's models with the Django ORM.  (Mostly
they are trivial, JSON blobs of stuff pulled from the remote
databases, to be used for short-term operations.)  I defined the
remote databases' models with SQLAlchemy.  It was easy to write
whatever queries I wanted, on whatever data I wanted, that way.  And
it made the actual separation of the local and remote data a lot more apparent
as I worked with the code: if I'm working on local data, I'm using
Django models; if I'm working with remote data, I'm using SQLAlchemy.
It felt cleaner that way.
</p>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>
SQLAlchemy models defined in a <code>project/remote.py</code> file.
</p>
<p>
Connection settings for the various remote databases defined
in <code>settings.py</code> in a dict:
</p>

{% highlight python %}
## settings.py
SQLALCHEMY_DB_CONNECTIONS = {
  'db1': "mysql://foo:bar@baz.com/db1",
  'db2': "mysql://foo:bar@baz.com/db2",
}      
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
In middleware, I attach a SQLAlchemy session object to each request.
The session object, which is used to query a database through
SQLAlchemy, can then be used in all the Django views:
</p>

{% highlight python %}
## app/views.py
from app import remote
def index(request):
    """
    Show a list of all available entries from the remote db.
    """
    entries = request.sqla_session.query(remote.EntryModel).all()
    return {
        'entries': entries
        }
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
One extra step: I wanted to select the database by traversal &mdash;
the first path segment in the URL would be one of the keys in
the <code>SQLALCHEMY_DB_CONNECTIONS</code> dict.  To do this, I
configured the root <code>urls.py</code> with a <code>db_name</code>
argument:
</p>

{% highlight python %}
## urls.py
urlpatterns = patterns(
    '',
    (r'^(?P<db_name>\w+)/', include('app.urls')),
)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
## app/middleware.py
from django.conf import settings
from django.http import HttpResponseNotFound
import re
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

class SQLAlchemySessionMiddleware(object):
    """
    Middleware component that adds an attribute `sqla_session` to the `request`
    object. The session is bound to a database which is selected by URL traversal,
    by finding (and deleting) the `db_name` from the kwargs about to be passed
    in to the view.

    The connection string is found by settings.SQLALCHEMY_DB_CONNECTIONS[db_name]
    which should be excluded from version control since it will include sensitive
    information like passwords for all available databases.
    """

    def process_view(self, request, view_func, view_args, view_kwargs):
        request.sqla_session = None
        request.db_name = None
        if 'db_name' not in view_kwargs:
            return None

        db_name = view_kwargs.pop('db_name')
        try:
            connection_string = settings.SQLALCHEMY_DB_CONNECTIONS[db_name]
        except KeyError:
            return HttpResponseNotFound("Database '%s' is not configured." % db_name)

        engine = create_engine(connection_string)
        Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

        request.sqla_session = Session()
        request.db_name = db_name

        return None
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Before a request reaches its target view, the middleware looks
for <code>db_name</code> in the view's kwargs.  If it's present, it
attaches a session to the request, and removes <code>db_name</code>
from <code>view_kwargs</code>, so that the app's view signatures can
ignore the <code>db_name</code> path segment completely.  That way the
same views can be reused with a different middleware that decides on a
remote database in some other way.
</p>

<p>
Probably this isn't the most efficient thing in the world, but it's
clean and it worked.  Since I was talking to read-only databases
through SQLAlchemy, I didn't really have to worry about managing
transactions or anything complicated.  And, conveniently, the
SQLAlchemy interfaces for results are similar enough to Django's that
pretty much everything I had to do with them in templates (including
wrapping them in a <code>Paginator</code>) just worked.
